# Basic Syntax

`//` is used to add comments.\
Use of semicolons (`;`) is not required.

All Java operators are supported (except a few bitwise operarors).

### Datatypes

All of the data types are interoperable with App Inventor.
`Bool`, `Int`, `Char`, `Float`, `Double`, `Any`, `Nil`, `List`, `Dict` are the supported types.

An example of few:

```swift copy
print(
    "Hello, World!", // a String
    'A',             // a Char
    true,            // a Bool
    123,             // an Int
    12.3,            // a Float
    3.14D,           // a Double
    makeList("App", "Inventor") // a List
    // a Dict
    makeDict(
        "India": "Delhi",
        "USA": "Washington DC"
    )
)
```

This outputs the following:

```
Hello, World!
A 
true
123
12.3
3.14
["App", "Inventor"]
{"India":"Delhi", "USA": "Washington DC"}
```

### Conditional Expressions

```swift copy
let x = 5
let y = 8

if (x > y) {
  print("X is greater")
} else if (x == y) {
  print("Both are equal!")
} else {
  print("Y is greater")
} 
```

You may use `if` not just for flow control, but also as an expression:

```swift copy
let x = 5
let y = 8

println(if (x > y) "X is greater" else "Y is greater")
```

### For loop

```swift copy
let places = arrayOf("India", "Japan", "Germany")
for (place in places) {
  print(place)
}
```

or the classical way:

```swift copy
let places = arrayOf("India", "Japan", "Germany")
for (var i = 0; i < len(places); i++) {
  print(places[i])
}
```

### Until loop

```swift copy
let places = arrayOf("India", "Japan", "Germany")
var index = 0
until (index < len(places)) {
  print("Item at index " + index + " is " + places[index])
  index++
}
```

### Special loop

It's one of the special features offered by Eia!

Iterating backwards from 5 to 1:

```swift copy
each (x: 5 to 1) {
  print(x)
}
```

Iteration from 2 to 10 by increment of 2:

```swift copy
each (y: 2 to 10 by 2) {
  print(x)
}
```

### Type checks and casting

Like Kotlin, the `is` checks if an expression belongs to a certain type.

```swift copy
let a = "Meow!"
println(a is String)            // true
println("Meow" + 8 is Int)      // false```
```

To cast values, for example from `Any` to `Int`, we use the cast operator `::` followed by a type:

```swift copy
// casting from Any to String
let name: Any = "Meow"
let reName: String = name::String
```
